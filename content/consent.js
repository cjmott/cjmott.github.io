<p><strong><u>INTRODUCTION:</u></strong> The purpose of this form is to give you information to help you decide if you want to take part in a research study. This consent form includes information about:&nbsp;</p><p>- why the study is being done;&nbsp;</p><p>- the things that you will be asked to do if you are in the study;&nbsp;</p><p>- any known risks involved;&nbsp;</p><p>- any potential benefit; and&nbsp;</p><p>- options, other than taking part in this study, that you have.&nbsp;</p><p>If at any time you have questions about the study, please e-mail Larisa Heiphetz Solomon at lah2201@columbia.edu. Take all the time you need to decide whether you want to take part in this research study. The purpose of this research is described below in the, "What is Involved in This Study?"; section of this consent form.</p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?:</u></strong> We are doing this research study to find out how children and adults think about right and wrong. You are being asked to take part in this study because you signed up for this session via Prolific. About 300 people are expected to enroll in this study. Adults will be enrolled if they sign up via Columbia's subject pool, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Prolific, or if they are recruited in-person.</p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY?:&nbsp;</u></strong>You will answer some questionnaires about your impressions of other people. You will also answer some questions about yourself. Some of these questions may be about different types of punishment (e.g., jail or prison). We will also ask about any prior contact you have had with the justice system. Taking part in this study will last about 20 minutes and will include only this experimental session (you do not need to complete other sessions in the future).</p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?:</u></strong> There may be risks or discomforts if you take part in this study. You may feel uncomfortable answering some of the questions we ask; however, you can end the study at any time for any reason without loss of compensation. You can also skip any experimental questions that you do not want to answer. There may be other risks of taking part in this research study that we don't know about. If we learn about other risks, we will let you know what they are so that you can decide whether or not you want to continue to be in the study. Although it is not a risk, taking part in this study involves the inconvenience of giving about 20 minutes of your time to complete questionnaires. A risk of taking part in this study is the possibility of a loss of confidentiality. Loss of confidentiality includes having your personal information shared with someone who is not on the study team and was not supposed to see or know about your information. The study team plans to protect your confidentiality. Their plans for keeping your information private are described in the confidentiality section of this consent form.</p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?:</u></strong> You will not receive personal (direct) benefit from taking part in this research study. However, the information collected from this research may help others in the future.</p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>WHAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE THERE?:</u></strong> You may choose not to take part in this research study.</p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>WHAT ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY?:</u></strong> Any information collected during this study that can identify you by name will be kept confidential. Hard copies of data files will be stored in a locked lab on Columbia's campus. Electronic files will be stored on password-protected computers. We will do everything we can to keep the data secure; however, complete confidentiality cannot be promised. Despite all of our efforts, unanticipated problems (such as a stolen computer) may occur, although it is highly unlikely. Your responses will be assigned a code number, and personally identifying information will not be recorded in our data files. Generally, only the investigator and study staff will have access to the file. However, the following individuals and/or agencies will be able to look at and copy your research records: 
</p><p>- The investigator, study staff and other professionals who may be evaluating the study 
</p><p>- Authorities from Columbia University, including the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
</p><p>- The Columbia Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) 
</p><p>- The Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) 
</p><p>- If this study is sponsored (money or supplies are being provided), the sponsor of this study, including persons or organizations working with or owned by the sponsor 
</p><p>- Other government regulatory agencies (including agencies in other countries) if the sponsor is seeking marketing approval for new products resulting from this research. 
</p><p>Data from this research will be analyzed by the research team and may be shared with other researchers and/or posted in online data repositories. However, it will not be possible to tie your responses to your identity. For example, by looking at the data, people will be able to determine that Participant #1006 strongly agreed with a particular item; however, the participant code number will not be linked with the participant's name, IP address, or other identifying information (such information will not be included in the data file at all).</p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>WILL I GET COMPENSATED?:</u></strong> You will receive approximately $9 per hour, which will be pro-rated to $3.00 for this 20 minute study, if you complete the entire survey, correctly answer the attention check questions, and do not satisfy another grounds for rejecting your task on Prolific (i.e., completing the survey exceptionally fast or objectively demonstrating clear low effort throughout the survey) or requesting return of the task. If you fail the attention check questions or your task is rejected or returned for some other reason, you will not receive payment.</p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>DO I HAVE TO BE IN THE STUDY?:</u></strong> Participation in this study is voluntary. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.</p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>WHOM DO I CONTACT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS?:</u></strong> If you have any questions or concerns about the study, you may contact Larisa Heiphetz Solomon at lah2201@columbia.edu.
